		Adaptability (untested)
	Changed Abilties:
		Huge Power now doubles Special Attacking Moves (Pure Power still doubles physical attacking moves)
	In Progress:

		HP Aware 
		any other AI scripts they had before

			Each Elite 4 member and Wallace will have new teams added for those 4 slots 
			In the base game they just use the same team for each rematch

		Additonal TMs for useful moves
		Add a prompt to chain repels
		Update repels to support more than 255 steps
			Repel 250
			Super Repel 500

Other Changes:
